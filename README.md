# Massage application

#What it does?
I created this app as a part of a ten man team at Nemetsheck Bulgaria for their two week Speed IT UP academy! The idea of the app is that users can open it and book and unbook massages for certain hours of the week.  We also made an admin page where the masseuse can check if a person has attended the massage and should pay. Also there is a statistics page of what every person should pay to the compnay and what the company needs to pay to the partner who provide the massages.

#What I worked on?
I worked on the backend mostly and accepted server requests and saved, manipulated and extracted data from the database. I have also helped with the sending of the request and writing the javascript at the front end. This is by no means a finished project and has many issues, but this is what we accomplished for the two weeks!
